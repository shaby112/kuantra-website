          <p>
            For years, setting up a simple dashboard meant stringing together an overly complex stack. You had to move data out of your database, drop it into a warehouse, write dbt models, and then connect a heavy BI tool just to see a bar chart.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was slow, expensive, and frankly, overkill for 90% of use cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            We realized most teams were not asking for more layers — they were asking for fewer moving parts and faster answers. So we designed Kuantra to remove setup drag, keep data where it already lives, and make insight generation feel immediate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kuantra is built for operators who need clarity, not ceremony: fast to deploy, private by default, and practical from day one.
